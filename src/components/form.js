'use strict'

//Write a form that updates redux state upon form selections for state, activities, parks, whatnot.

//Use redux state to build request.query.params to send to make axios API calls to back end routes.

//IDEA - have user select park, then update state to that parkCode, then be able to search for campgrounds, activities, alerts, etc based on that park.

Author: Jessi Velazquez

**This appication is currently in its eary stages of development, and thus this README is currently designated for developer notes at this time**

## Idea

**MVP:**

This will be an application where a user can get recommendations for hiking adventures based on criteria they set. They can add the hikes to their favorite list, which is attached to their user account. The hikes will be queried from a public API.

**MORE:**

- Users can add notes/pictures to their favorite hikes - trip reports

- Users can build out their profile/about me section

- Users can use GPS to track their hikes

- Users can connect with other users and browse their favorites/trip reports
